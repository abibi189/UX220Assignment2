### Apple Picking

I went to an apple picking. It was a tradition in elementary schools in Montr√©al; every year, they would plan a trip there. We got to pick up apples on our own, and then the next day, in class, we would make apple pies with the apples we got from our trip. 
We went there when I was around grade 3-4. It was a good experience because you got to have your pie with your efforts from picking the apples. 
My favourite memory is when the pie was made; you got to decorate it. They would give you sauces that you could drizzle on.
The part I did not enjoy was when you had to pick up apples with your hands and no gloves. The hands would have gotten dirty, but there was a sanitization section to clean your hands before picking up the apples.

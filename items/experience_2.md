### Cabane à Sucre

A cabane à sucre means a sugar shack, usually occurring in the Winter. My friends and I went to this place once; we had to walk around the area before we dined at the main entrance. The first thing we did was explore the site; we had to walk in the snow to go to these trees where they were sugar buckets laid there. We then observed how the people who worked there made the maple syrup using those buckets, and then we rolled the cold, frozen syrup into a popsicle stick, and then we got to eat them. From there, we went to the main sap house and got to eat pancakes with the syrup we observed.
It was when we were in middle school in the Winter. It was a fun experience; the good part was that we had delicious hand-made syrup. It wasn't that sweet, and the texture was very fresh.
My favourite memory was probably when my friends and I had a snowball fight. The part I did not enjoy was when we had to walk in such heavy snow; our boots were sinking, and the walk made us more tired by the pressure of the snow.

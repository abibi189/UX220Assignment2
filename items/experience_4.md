### Working at Walmart

I worked at Walmart as a Cashier/ Customer Service. It was a part-time job; I had to check out customer items, and sometimes, I would be at the customer service desk to give refunds or if there was an issue with the items. 
It was about three years ago, during the start of Covid-19. The good part was that the job was pretty good, easy to flow, and primarily independent. 
Usually, working as a team only occurs when something significant happens. My favourite memory was when it was a holiday, like "Thanksgiving," we would have a day off!
 I did not enjoy the manager, as I was given a part-time role; she kept giving me full-time hours, and it was configured through my classes.

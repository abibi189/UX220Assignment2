### First-time on Wonderland

We went to Wonderland, and by then, we were still living in Montréal; we only came to Ontario to visit our cousins. We wanted to try Wonderland to see how big it was. I went with my family; we explored a bunch of rides and tried out the food. 
We went about eight years ago. The good part was that the rides were significantly bigger than the amusement park in Montréal, which was much smaller.
My favourite memory was the Wind Seeker ride; we would spin around. The part I did not enjoy was that my brother feared heights, so we had to either let him stay on the ground or take him on a less fun ride. He did not get to experience much of it.

### Face-Painting

I had volunteered for a day at a public school, where they had a carnival for the children to enjoy. I had to get my hours done for my high school prerequisite, so I did a face painting. I gave the children some references of what they wanted, and from there, I painted their faces carefully by not hurting their eyes, nose, or mouth.
This happened four years ago. My favourite memory was that the kids were calm; they did not move so much if you entertained them. 
Their reactions were my favourite towards the end of the face-paint session. What I did not enjoy was when we had to clean up other sections, but overall, it was great.
